Fade-to-Black Randomizer for text-based roleplaying games

In any text-based roleplaying game involving relationships, romance is bound to happen and with that, sex! Sometimes, players may not be able to engage in a written scene for a variety of reasons (time, availability, preference, etc). In these cases, it is appropriate for players to "fade to black" or "FTB" and decide how the scene played out.

While this originally started as a joke between two players, the frequency of FTB between their characters showed that a randomizer for this purpose would be helpful. This tool is written in JavaScript by a beginner.

Functionality is simple: this version only includes a button to bring a random outcome from an array. Future versions may include inputs by players or inclusion of character names to random results further.
